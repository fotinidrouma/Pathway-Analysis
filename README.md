# Thesis
File 'Pathway Analysis' contains all methods.
File 'Pathway Analysis- Main Script' contains the data and each method is called from another script.
Files 'PRS' and 'MinePath' refer to each tools methodology and implement the corresponding functions, which are called in 'Pathway Analysis- Main Script' (all the other tools will also be implemented in such form). 

Changes:
1. MinePath discretization method corrections
2. One sub-path and one sample at a time for each method's functions
