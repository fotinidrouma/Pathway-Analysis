# Thesis
File 'Pathway Analysis': contains all methods in their primary implementation.
File 'Pathway Analysis- Main Script': the 'Pathway Analysis' file with corrections.
Files 'PRS' and 'MinePath' refer to each tools methodology and implement the corresponding functions, which are called in 'Pathway Analysis- Main Script' (all the other tools will also be implemented in such form). 

Changes:
1. MinePath discretization method corrections
2. One sub-path and one sample at a time for each method's functions

Completed:
MinePath
