## About the project
The goal of this study was to compare the findings to earlier research in order to determine the most efficient method for pathway analysis using the technologies that are currently provided. A Decision Tree algorithm was used to evaluate the results after implementing the scoring method for various Pathway Analysis tools. TAPPA, PRS, TEAK, DEAP, GraphiteWeb, MinePath, and HiPathia were the tools chosen for implementation.
