# Thesis
File 'Pathway Analysis': contains all methods in their primary implementation.
File 'Pathway Analysis- Main Script': the 'Pathway Analysis' file with corrections.
Results: GraphiteWeb is still computing, must be unzipped

Changes in 'Pathway Analysis- Main Script':
1. MinePath discretization method corrections
2. For genes' significance the z-score is employed (threshold=1.96 corresponding to p-value's threshold 0.05)
3. Calculated the scores for each sample and sub-path for MinePath and TAPPA

Implementation Completed:
1. MinePath
2. TAPPA
3. GraphiteWeb
4. TEAK
5. DEAP
6. PRS
7. HiPathia
8. SPIA

Results Calculated (some files are too big for git):
1. MinePath
2. TAPPA
3. TEAK
4. HiPathia

Results Calculating (files are compressed because of the size, must be unzipped before running code):
1. GraphiteWeb 
2. TEAK: the file is too big for git
