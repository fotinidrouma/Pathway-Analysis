## <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
The goal of this study was to compare the findings to earlier research in order to determine the most efficient approach for pathway analysis using the technologies that are currently provided. A Decision Tree algorithm was used to evaluate the results after implementing the scoring method for various Pathway Analysis tools. TAPPA, PRS, TEAK, DEAP, GraphiteWeb, MinePath, and HiPathia were the tools chosen for implementation.

The project is implemented using the Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook.

## <a name="setup">Setup</a>
To run this project, install it locally and launch the Jupyter Notebook App by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):
```sh
   jupyter notebook
```

## <a name="usage">Usage</a>
To acquire the files containing the estimated path scores that are missing from the "Results" folder, uncomment the code blocks in sections 2.2.3, 2.4.2, 2.5.4 and 2.7.3, and run all cells. It is estimated that this procedure would take approximately 17 hours.
